# Landingpage
The project is intended to practice the flexbox and other css design principles as seen on the odin project. Possible challenges anticipated will relate to responsive design and ensuring that media queries accomodate all specifications available. It won't try to veer so much outside the stated goals and will mostly try to fufill the user stories.
Challenges faced during the course of this project will be captured here as well as principles used.
Flexbox will be used to ensure that the page is responsive.
#Challenges
The challenges faced were numerous especially in responsive design and the project took way longer than neccessary. This is due to not designing using mobile first principles at the initial stage and while this has mostly been fixed, the project took a much longer time than it should.
